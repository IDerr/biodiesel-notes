[[{"l":"Welcome to Biodiesel docss"}],[{"l":"Oil preparation","p":["First of all, you need to prepare your oil to make good quality bio diesel.","First thing you will be looking on is Free Fatty Acids aka FFA which directly impact biodiesel's quality. They are commonly released when fried or is naturally present in some oils (Corn Oil, Rapeseed, Jatropha).","Generally speaking, if you have a FFA rate above 3%, you will need to pretreat your oil."]},{"l":"Pretreatements"},{"l":"Acid Esterification","p":["Methanol and sulfuric acid are mixed with oils, and FFA is converted into methyl esters. This process results in no yield loss and no soap production. However, it does create some water which stops the reaction. One approch to deal with that, is to add a lot of methanol to not limit the reaction (40:1 molar ratio minimum) as stated here"]},{"l":"Other methods","p":["Caustic method can also be used, but isn't very efficient due to creation of soap during the reaction."]},{"l":"Sources","p":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016236116000272 https://youtu.be/NPF6vdfLHlU https://www.lct.ugent.be/sites/default/files/events/Lecture%202%20Studies%20on%20esterification%20of%20Free%20Fatty%20Acids%20in%20biodiesel%20production.pdf"]}]]
