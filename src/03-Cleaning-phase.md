# Cleaning phase

Now that the transetherification process is done, we need to clean the possible impurities generated during the process.
Here's a possible list of impurities:
 - Excess methanol
 - Glycerin
 - Soap

## Methods
### Water
Easiest method, we add water to the solution, due to the polarity, impurities cited above will be more attracted to water.
Multiple iterations of the process can be used to get a cleaner product.
