# Cleaning phase

## Introduction

First of all, you need to prepare your oil to make good quality bio diesel.

First thing you will be looking on is Free Fatty Acids aka FFA which directly impact biodiesel's quality. 
They are commonly released when fried or is naturally present in some oils (Corn Oil, Rapeseed, Jatropha).

Generally speaking, if you have a FFA rate above 3%, you will need to pretreat your oil.

## Pretreatements
### Acid Esterification

Methanol and sulfuric acid are mixed with oils, and FFA is converted into methyl esters. This process results in no yield loss and no soap production.
However, it does create some water which can stop the reaction. 
We can solve this by adding methanol to the mix to not limit the reaction (40:1 molar ratio) as stated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPF6vdfLHlU)


### Other methods
Caustic method can also be used, but isn't very efficient due to creation of soap during the reaction.
